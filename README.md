# FPGA-Based-LED-Brightness-Controller-Using-PWM-or-PWM-Genetator-
Generation of Pulse Width Modulation Using Verilog HDL
•	This project was aimed to implement PWM using Verilog Hardware Descriptive Language.
•	It was requested on May 05, 2017.
•	Submitted in partial fulfillment of the course, Digital Logic Design.
•	Project was prepared by:
Irfan Danish [CIIT/FA15-BEL-012/ISB]
Hammad Munir [CIIT/FA15-BEL-034/ISB]

•	LED Brightness controller based on PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).
•	Spartan 6 XC6SLX9 used to implement the project.
•	ModelSim SE 5.7f is used for Programming & Simulation.
•	Xilinx ISE 12.2 is used to implement the code on FPGA.
•	Major task was to produce capricious duty cycles.
•	There are total 12 Verilog programming modules for this project.
•	11 modules consisting 380 lines of Verilog code for design.
•	1 module consisting 200 lines of Verilog code for Test Bench.
